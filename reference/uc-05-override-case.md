# Module 1 · Application Verification — UC 05 · Override Case

> AI implementation brief, generated from the v5 spec (`spec/.../use-cases/`). Source of truth is the spec; regenerate, don't hand-edit.

## Context

- Module: 1 · Application Verification · category Rule · domain `verification` · command `verify-application` · outcomes: PASSED, FAILED, REVIEW
- Use case: 05 · Override Case · track B · prerequisite: after 02 is wired · build shape: DB-write→API→FE · primary screen: Override modal
- Data effect: two writes + one callback
- Platform rules (non-negotiable): the orchestrator is the only caller; the whole application arrives in the envelope (plus the v5 `outputs` block, Option A); steps are independent and re-orderable; the payload is NEVER stored — only `applicationId`; every module ships `GET /cases/{id}/applicant` proxying the orchestrator; big lists are empty by default and capped at 10 rows (≤10 hydration calls); ALL APIs are idempotent — same request twice, same result once; every endpoint appears in the service's OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec.

## Story

As a bank employee I want to override a failed or flagged case with a reason, when the automatic decision is wrong.

## Contract

```
POST /cases/{id}/override
{"newOutcome":"PASSED",
 "reason":"DOB typo — applicant is 19",
 "operator":"b.dimovski"}
→ 200 + updated case
```

## Acceptance criteria

1. POST /cases/{id}/override {newOutcome, reason, operator} → 200; the case's outcome updates immediately.
2. reason and operator are mandatory → 400 without either; newOutcome must be PASSED, FAILED or REVIEW.
3. An override_log row is written: applicationId, old outcome, new outcome, reason, operator, timestamp.
4. The module POSTs a fresh callback with status local-manual and the new outcome — a journey parked on REVIEW resumes.
5. Overriding Priya's FAILED case to PASSED shows the new outcome on the board, and the override in the case history.  ⟵ **checkpoint — exact value**
6. The original ruleResults stay untouched — the record shows what the machine decided AND what the human decided.

## Expected data changes

- **UPDATE verification_record** SET outcome = 'PASSED' — the only field that may ever change.
- **INSERT override_log** (old, new, reason, operator, at).
- Callback status local-manual tells the orchestrator a human decided — the journey resumes.
- ruleResults JSON untouched: machine view preserved forever.

### Entity model (suggested — the shape to beat)

![Entity model](diagrams/er-suggested.jpg)

**VerificationRecord — one row per applicationId (unique)**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | PK | the journey key from the envelope — one row per application, and the ONLY applicant-related column |
| outcome | enum |  | the final answer: PASSED, FAILED or REVIEW — changed only through the Override endpoint |
| reference | string |  | human-facing case reference shown on every screen, e.g. ver-000123 |
| productConfigVersion | int | FK | the ProductConfig version this decision used — pinned forever for explainability |
| ruleResults | JSON |  | embedded results of the four checks — wellFormedness with per-field reasons, then age, productActive and channel, each with passed + reason code |
| submittedAt | timestamp |  | when the orchestrator submitted the case |

**ProductConfig — insert-only, versioned product terms; the current version is the highest per product**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| productCode | string | PK | which product the terms govern: CREDIT_CARD_STANDARD, _REWARDS or _STUDENT — key together with version |
| version | int | PK | one new row per change — rows are inserted, never updated; current = the highest version per product |
| minAge | int |  | the age rule's threshold — below it FAILED, exactly at it REVIEW (seeded 18 for all three products) |
| limitMin | int |  | the smallest requestable credit limit in GBP — the sweep fails requests below it |
| limitMax | int |  | the largest requestable credit limit in GBP — above it fails the sweep, exactly at it goes to REVIEW |
| active | boolean |  | the product-active rule — false on the current version fails every new application (VER_PRODUCT_INACTIVE) |
| channels | string[] |  | the channel rule — where the product may be sold, e.g. [WEB, MOBILE_APP]; any other channel fails (VER_CHANNEL_NOT_ELIGIBLE) |
| effectiveFrom | timestamp |  | when this version became the current one |

**OverrideLog — audit trail; one row per manual override, none ever deleted**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | FK | the case that was overridden |
| oldOutcome | enum |  | the outcome before the override |
| newOutcome | enum |  | the outcome after the override |
| reason | string |  | the mandatory justification typed by the operator |
| operator | string |  | who performed the override |
| overriddenAt | timestamp |  | when it happened |

Relationships: VerificationRecord N:1 ProductConfig — each decision pins the version it used · VerificationRecord 1:N OverrideLog — every override is audited to its case

## Out of scope

Deleting or editing any other field of the record; overriding a case that does not exist (404).

## Build notes

The ONE permitted mutation of a VerificationRecord. Writes the shared override_log and re-notifies the orchestrator with callback status local-manual, so a parked journey resumes.

## Tests

Slice test: happy path, missing reason → 400, unknown id → 404; service test asserts the callback fires once.

## Definition of done

All acceptance criteria verified against the running app · `./mvnw test` green · teammate-reviewed PR merged to main · fresh clone builds green · endpoint idempotent + present in the OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec · demoable from the UI.
