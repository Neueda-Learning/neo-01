# Module 1 · Application Verification — UC 08 · Employment-status eligibility (CANDIDATE)

> AI implementation brief, generated from the v5 spec (`spec/.../use-cases/`). Source of truth is the spec; regenerate, don't hand-edit.

## Context

- Module: 1 · Application Verification · category Rule · domain `verification` · command `verify-application` · outcomes: PASSED, FAILED, REVIEW
- Use case: 08 · Employment-status eligibility · track B · prerequisite: after 01–07 · build shape: rule engine ext. · primary screen: Case Detail (rule 4)
- Data effect: config field + engine branch
- Platform rules (non-negotiable): the orchestrator is the only caller; the whole application arrives in the envelope (plus the v5 `outputs` block, Option A); steps are independent and re-orderable; the payload is NEVER stored — only `applicationId`; every module ships `GET /cases/{id}/applicant` proxying the orchestrator; big lists are empty by default and capped at 10 rows (≤10 hydration calls); ALL APIs are idempotent — same request twice, same result once; every endpoint appears in the service's OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec.

## Story

Some products are only for some employment situations: a STUDENT card requires employment.status = STUDENT. A categorical offer-eligibility filter — distinct from module 5, which uses employment data for affordability arithmetic.

## What it adds

- ProductConfig gains `allowedEmploymentStatuses` (nullable — null means no restriction).
- The engine gains rule 4; ruleResults gains a 5th section when the product carries a restriction.
- New reason code `VER_EMPLOYMENT_STATUS_NOT_ELIGIBLE` — a v5 contract addition, instructor applies it.
- Seed change: CREDIT_CARD_STUDENT restricts to [STUDENT]; the other two products stay unrestricted.

## Acceptance criteria

1. A STUDENT-card application with employment.status=STUDENT passes rule 4.
2. The same application with status=PERMANENT → FAILED + VER_EMPLOYMENT_STATUS_NOT_ELIGIBLE.
3. Products with allowedEmploymentStatuses = null are unaffected — all seven UC 01–07 ACs still pass unchanged.
4. The restriction is versioned config: a new ProductConfig version can add or drop it without a deploy, and old cases keep their pinned version.
5. The Case Detail screen renders the extra rule card only when the decision includes it.

### Entity model (suggested — the shape to beat)

![Entity model](diagrams/er-suggested.jpg)

**VerificationRecord — one row per applicationId (unique)**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | PK | the journey key from the envelope — one row per application, and the ONLY applicant-related column |
| outcome | enum |  | the final answer: PASSED, FAILED or REVIEW — changed only through the Override endpoint |
| reference | string |  | human-facing case reference shown on every screen, e.g. ver-000123 |
| productConfigVersion | int | FK | the ProductConfig version this decision used — pinned forever for explainability |
| ruleResults | JSON |  | embedded results of the four checks — wellFormedness with per-field reasons, then age, productActive and channel, each with passed + reason code |
| submittedAt | timestamp |  | when the orchestrator submitted the case |

**ProductConfig — insert-only, versioned product terms; the current version is the highest per product**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| productCode | string | PK | which product the terms govern: CREDIT_CARD_STANDARD, _REWARDS or _STUDENT — key together with version |
| version | int | PK | one new row per change — rows are inserted, never updated; current = the highest version per product |
| minAge | int |  | the age rule's threshold — below it FAILED, exactly at it REVIEW (seeded 18 for all three products) |
| limitMin | int |  | the smallest requestable credit limit in GBP — the sweep fails requests below it |
| limitMax | int |  | the largest requestable credit limit in GBP — above it fails the sweep, exactly at it goes to REVIEW |
| active | boolean |  | the product-active rule — false on the current version fails every new application (VER_PRODUCT_INACTIVE) |
| channels | string[] |  | the channel rule — where the product may be sold, e.g. [WEB, MOBILE_APP]; any other channel fails (VER_CHANNEL_NOT_ELIGIBLE) |
| effectiveFrom | timestamp |  | when this version became the current one |

**OverrideLog — audit trail; one row per manual override, none ever deleted**

| field | type | key | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| applicationId | string | FK | the case that was overridden |
| oldOutcome | enum |  | the outcome before the override |
| newOutcome | enum |  | the outcome after the override |
| reason | string |  | the mandatory justification typed by the operator |
| operator | string |  | who performed the override |
| overriddenAt | timestamp |  | when it happened |

## Why this one

Cheapest candidate on the module's list: no new entity, no new mock, one config field + one engine branch — and it demos well (flip the STUDENT restriction live). The other Candidate rules for module 1 stay unadopted in v5.

## Definition of done

All acceptance criteria verified against the running app · `./mvnw test` green · teammate-reviewed PR merged to main · fresh clone builds green · endpoint idempotent + present in the OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger) spec · demoable from the UI.
